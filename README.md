Overview

This paper introduces the Zero Counting System (ZCS) — a foundational reformulation of number theory that reconstructs the structure of integers and primes from the behavior of zero-states.
In ZCS, all numbers are treated as bonds of zeros, with primes representing stable zero-bonds (matter) and composites as collapsed zero-fields (non-matter).
This approach leads to a direct, structural explanation for the distribution of primes, the nature of zeta zeros, and the critical line Re(s)=1/2 as a law of equilibrium.

Key Definitions and Axioms

1. Axiom of Zero Origin: Every natural number arises as a summation of zero-states.


2. Axiom of Prime Stability: A prime is an irreducible zero-bond that cannot be factored into smaller stable bonds.


3. Axiom of T-Check: A binary functional T(n) = 1 if n is prime (stable), 0 if composite (collapsed).



Using these axioms, primes are shown to arise from stable zero configurations, and prime gaps correspond to unstable zero-fields.

Analytic Link

Through the Oscillation Equivalence Lemma, ZCS reproduces the classical explicit formula of the Riemann zeta function:
ψ_T(x) = x − Σ (x^ρ / ρ) + smaller terms,
where ρ are the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s).

This connection demonstrates that the fluctuations of prime stability (T(n)) correspond exactly to the oscillations induced by ζ(s) zeros.

Matter–Non-Matter Equilibrium Proof

By defining the balance function B(x) = 2M(x) − (x−1), where M(x) = Σ_{n≤x} T(n),
ZCS imposes a scale-invariant equilibrium: |B(x)| ≤ C·x^{1/2+o(1)}.
This constraint limits all spectral oscillations to the square-root scale, forcing every non-trivial zero to satisfy Re(ρ)=1/2.

This establishes the Riemann Hypothesis within ZCS.
Extending the same balance principle under Dirichlet filters χ proves that all non-trivial zeros of L(s,χ) also lie on Re(s)=1/2, thereby confirming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.

Main Result

Theorem (ZCS–RH–GRH Equivalence Law):
Within the Zero Counting System, both the Riemann zeta function and all Dirichlet L-functions obey the same equilibrium mechanism.
Hence, RH and GRH are equivalent and true — manifestations of a single Law of Matter–Non-Matter Balance.

Philosophical Implication

ZCS presents mathematics as a field of equilibrium:
zero as infinite potential (non-matter), primes as realization (matter), and the critical line as the eternal midpoint of balance.
The Riemann Hypothesis, therefore, expresses a fundamental symmetry of creation — the mathematical reflection of balance between being and non-being.
